Triangles:
	Centroid, Circuntrentre and Orthocentre lie in a line. Centroid is always in the middle, centroid-orthocentre is twice centroid-circumcentre.

	Centroid:
		If you make a line between each node and the middle of each edge, where they intercept is the centroid. The centroid's distance to an edge is 1/3 (of total dist) and 2/3 to the node. It can be calculated by the average of each of the points of the triangle.

	Altitude:
		A line that goes through a vertex and is perpendicular to the opposite side.

	Orthocentre:
		The point where the three altitudes meet.

	Herons:
		a, b, c are the lengths of the sides.
		S = (a+b+c)/2
		Area = sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))

	Angle bisector:
		Divide an angle in half, its a line. Points in this line are in the same distance from each of the sides it divides.

	Incircle:
		Circle inside the triangle.
		The incircle point is in the intercection of two angle bisectors of the triangle.
		Radius: Area/S (from herons).



Lines:
Let m be the slope of this line.
	Perpendicular:
		The slope of a line perpendicular to the current one is -1/m.

Half infinite ray:

	Half infinite ray AB. (could work?)Make l(A, B), l1(A, B+l.v/abs(l.v)*1e9). l1 is the half inf ray.
	
Angles:
	Inside angles:
		Sum of inside angles is (n-2)*180

	Exterior angle:
		Exterior angle is when you extend the side of the poligon, and get complement of the angle.
		The total sum of all EA is 360.
